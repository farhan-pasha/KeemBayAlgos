Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string s. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:

If the group's length is 1, append the character to s.
Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
The compressed string s should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array chars. Note that group lengths that are 10 or longer will be split into multiple characters in chars.

After you are done modifying the input array, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

 

Example 1:

Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
Explanation: The groups are "aa", "bb", and "ccc". This compresses to "a2b2c3".
Example 2:

Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first character of the input array should be: ["a"]
Explanation: The only group is "a", which remains uncompressed since it's a single character.
Example 3:

Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "a" and "bbbbbbbbbbbb". This compresses to "ab12".
Example 4:

Input: chars = ["a","a","a","b","b","a","a"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","3","b","2","a","2"].
Explanation: The groups are "aaa", "bb", and "aa". This compresses to "a3b2a2". Note that each group is independent even if two groups have the same character.
 

Constraints:

1 <= chars.length <= 2000
chars[i] is a lower-case English letter, upper-case English letter, digit, or symbol.

The compressions algo specified basically mentions to do an in-place compression where chars if found repeating,
we need to replace all the repeating chars with the number of repeatition. 
Note: AS we know each elem in char array can only store 1 digit, we need to take care of multi-digit repeatition number.
So suppose if we have repeatition of 'a' 10 times, 
we need to modify the array as ["1","0"]

index=0;
Used 2 pointers i and j, i is incremented everytime when chars[i] == chars[j].
If the above is not true, ie,chars[i] != chars[j], we need to do 2 things:-

1. we then modify the elem of array at 'index' equal to char[j]. 
We also need to increment the 'index', so that it will now point to next elem.

2. if i-j>1, 
we convert the diff to string, run a for loop by converting this string to charArray to store the repeatition.
As we noted earlier that array of char will only save 1 digit at a time. Hence we run a for loop in this case.

Note: We also need to see if our pointer has reached the end of char array or not. 
for(int i=0;i<chars.length+1;i++){//Let the pointer go past the length,
	if (i<chars.length && chars[i] == chars[j]) { //check here if thats the case, do not do 'continue' 
		continue;
	}

Why the above?
Consider : ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
		             j           i
	     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7         Now i-j will have the right value which is 7-4,3	     

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity:O(1)
