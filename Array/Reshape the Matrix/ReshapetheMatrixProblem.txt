In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

Example 1:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
Example 2:
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
Note:
The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
The given r and c are all positive.
Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose
 of space complexity analysis.)

The logic:
Convert the input matrix to 1D array and keep pushing each elements based on the row and columns provided in the input.
Also, check if it is legal to reshape that matrix, if not, as question mentions, return the old input matrix.\
To check if it is legal to reshape that matrix: the product of rows and columns of inputs matrix 
should match the products of r and c (inputs).

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
