Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

First thing that comes to mind is using Hashmap. Two hashmap or 1 hashmap+1hashset can be used to remember the relationships between chars.



Better way: 
Logic is to maintain a relationship between two chars from s and t using thier indexes
s = |a|     ==>   |  |   | 67  |   |   |    |    |  sArr (array of size 256)
                   0  ...  65   ...          255
    
t = |c|     ==>   |  |   |  |   | 67 |    |    |  tArr (array of size 256)
                   0  ...         67        255

Now suppose next char in s and t are c and d respectively, 
we should compare there values if either of the values present in the index of s[c] and s[d] are not zero, 
which means it was accessed before and therefore should have values other than zero! 
If values obtained on those two indexes are not zero, we should compare them with each other and they should be equal otherwise not isomorphic.

if (sm[sc] == 0 && tm[tc] == 0) { //If both the index didn't have any value in them        
	sm[sc] = tc;  //Any value can be saved to these index like tc/sc/R-> any value which is distinct!
        tm[tc] = tc;
} else if (sm[sc] != tm[tc]) { //Else one of them was accessed before and therefore needs to be checked to see if the values in them are same or not
        return false;
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
